This repository contains my solutions to some exercises from “Introduction to Statistical Learning (Python Edition)”.

The main goal of this project is to:
- Strengthen my understanding of key statistical learning concepts;
- Practice implementing methods from scratch or using Python libraries;
- Get acquainted with real world data sets.

Each folder contains the lab exercises of a chapter. Each includes:
- My solution to the problem;
- My analysis on the results;
- Plots to make the data understanding easier.
